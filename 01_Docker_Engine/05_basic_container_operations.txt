Docker Objects:
General format of docker commands is as follows:

docker <docker-object> <sub-command> [options] <Arguments/Commands>

To list differnet docker objects, use docker <docker-object> ls. As in:
docker image ls
docker container ls
docker volume ls
docker network ls

To run a container:

docker container run -it ubuntu

To build an image:

docker image build .

To attach to a running container:

docker container attach ubuntu

To kill a running instance of a container:

docker container kill ubuntu

Two syntaxs of docker commands:

1. docker <docker-object> <sub-command> [options] <Arguments/Commands>

2. docker <sub-command> [options] <Arguments/Commands>

1. is the newer syntax, and we will use this in future. 2. is the older syntax, and it still works. But we wont use 2 type of syntax anymore.

Container Create - Create a new container
Eg:
docker container create httpd

In Unix, when we create docker, it creates a path /var/lib/docker (Do note that I could not find a path synonymous to /var/lib/docker on MacOS) to store all image and container related files. Ins

ls /var/lib/docker

In this folder above, we will find separate directories that docker manages. Under the containers directory, we can find the a new directory created with a unique id of the container. Within thatdirectory, we can see all files of the container. The files inside this will be as 'Checkpoint', 'hostconfig.json' and 'config.v2.json'

docker container ls command lists all container info, while docker container ls -a lists all running, stopped and created containers. Docker also assigns a random name if we do not specify a name

-l shows the last created container
docker container ls -l  

-q shows short created id for running containers
docker container ls -q

-aq shows short ids for all running,stopped and created containers
docker container ls -aq

Container Start - Start a container we created
Eg:
docker container start cc14fbf7fee8

Container Run - Create and Start a container

If we want to combine create and start container command, we can use docker container run command as follows
Eg:
docker container run ubuntu
